# NotNullAttributeUnity
Simple additional attribute to add to your Unity code to let your designers know they need to add something in that field.

Should you have written some code which absolutely needs a user to set some references in the Unity Editor, you can now mark them with [NotNull].
This gives the user a simple warning that they should add some values there.
